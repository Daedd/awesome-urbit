# awesome-urbit

Resources to help new users orient themselves around - and easily get started with - Urbit. This repository complements the [existing introductory documentation](https://urbit.org/getting-started). The [urbit/awesome-urbit](https://github.com/urbit/awesome-urbit) repo is a great next step once you have joined the network.

## Getting Started

The many existing hosting providers that come with a planet are excellent - but these involve both vague and explicit commitments. We've found this to be a barrier to entry for those wanting to quickly experiment trying out Urbit and existing apps, in a throwaway environment. They also obfuscate what is happening under the hood. To this end, the following doc explains a repeatable process for deploying comets on Digital Ocean:

- [Deploying Urbit Comets on Digital Ocean](/docs/comets-on-DO.md)

## Using Osmosis

Stock Urbit comes with a few apps - but there is a whole world of cool apps out there - and they aren't searcheable. Many are slow and require persistence to get working. Osmosis just works (if you know how to install it). Read along:

## Visualizing Urbit

Urbit introduces a plethora of new terminology; this diagram helps "view" things in a coherent way.
